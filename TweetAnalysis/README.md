# Installation

## Option 1
To install the required libraries, follow these steps:

```
pip install sklearn
pip install nltk
pip install matplotlib
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scipy
pip install pickle
```

Make sure you have all files within the same folder, since they are being imported to main. Note that the dataset does not need to be in the same folder, leave it in the directory "dataset".
Once all of the required libraries have been installed, you should be able to run the code that imports them.


The data_updated and data_updated2 are the CSV files that are clean, if you want to skip the cleaningprocess, use the dat_updated file, otherwise just run all cells as usual.
